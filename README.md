### Drug Efficacy Studies in Mouse Models of Squamous Cell Carcinoma

##### Sumukh Kumble

#### Introduction

Pymaceuticals have commissioned a study to investigate a number of lead candidates for their efficacy in reducing tumor volumes in mouse models of squamous cell carcinoma. The data sets obtained from this study have been analysed in great detail to determine which of the list of drug candidates indeed shows the most promise that warrant further clinical investigations based on the analyses that has been witnessed in these murine models. 



#### Data Analysis

##### Data cleaning

Due to the presence of duplicate data within the set, the mouse with the ID of g989 has been dropped from the dataset for subsequent data analysis. The data for this mouse is available within the supplementary 'data folder' in this repository. 

##### Summary Statistics

Of all the drugs assessed in this study, Capomulin appears to have the lowest mean tumour volume compared to all other drugs assessed in this study.
